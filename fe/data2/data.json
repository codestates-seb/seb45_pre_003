I can open a sound file using the Qt file picker dialog and then I get the url to that sound file. For example, I get file:///private/var/mobile/Containers/Data/Application/4557D5E4-68BA-4341-9F4F-2A07D5E87B4D/tmp/runsomething.App-Inbox/myaudiofile.wav So I can at that moment load the audio file into the QAudioPlayer and it works and plays. I then store this URL in a json file to later retrieve it. And the problem is that this seems to be a sort of temporary file url, because upon restart of my application, that URL does not work anymore.So, my question is how to handle this? Do I need to copy it myself to my own dir that I can create for example under the 'Library/Application Support' path: /var /mobile/Containers/Data/Application/4557D5E4-68BA-4341-9F4F-2A07D5E87B4D/Library/Application Support/App? Or is there some other way? I saw this post which allows a user to share a file with your application and seems to copy it inside your apps' storage. Then probably it will not be a 'tmp' file anymore and the link to that file will work even after application restarts. Is that how you should do it? I don't really like that approach and would like to avoid it if possible.",
